# Default StyleWright Guide

This is the StyleWright application's built-in style guide.

## Key Principles:

- **Clarity:** Write in a clear and easy-to-understand manner.
- **Conciseness:** Avoid unnecessary words and be direct.
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistent terminology, tone, and formatting.

## Specific Rules (Examples):

- **Active Voice:** Prefer active voice over passive voice.
  - *Example:* "The team developed the feature." (Active) vs. "The feature was developed by the team." (Passive)
- **Simple Language:** Use simple words and avoid jargon where possible.
  - *Example:* Use "use" instead of "utilize."
- **Abbreviations:** Define abbreviations on first use.
- **Numbers:** Spell out numbers one through nine; use numerals for 10 and above.
- **Oxford Comma:** Consistently use or omit the Oxford comma based on a defined standard (e.g., always use it).
